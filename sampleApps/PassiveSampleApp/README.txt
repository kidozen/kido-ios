# Passive Sample Application readme.

This is the sample application that shows how passive authentication works.
You need to have an application key for this to work. You can get it in the details of your Kidozenâ€™s application. 

Also, first build kidozen's library. To do so, open Kidozen's library, select the kidozen.client.fat and build.  This will create the required library and then this application will be able to run

Have a look at the Passive Authentication Documentation at http://docs.kidozen.com/ios-passive-authentication/
