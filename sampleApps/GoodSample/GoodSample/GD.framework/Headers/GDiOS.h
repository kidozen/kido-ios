 * The user's entitlement to the application may later be revoked or

 *
 * <H3>Good Dynamics Platform Connection</H3>
 * Establishing a connection to the Good Dynamics platform requires
 * authorization of the end user, and of the application. Both authorizations
 * are initiated by a single call to the <TT>authorize</TT> function.
 *
 * The <TT>authorize</TT> function call is typically made when the
 * application starts, in the
 * <TT>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</TT> handler. It is possible
 * to initiate authorization processing earlier in the execution cycle, see
 * under Early Authorization in the API Restrictions section, below, for
 * details.
 *
 * Authorization generally includes establishing a data connection to the GD
 * proxy infrastructure, and hence to the enterprise that provisioned the end
 * user. In addition, authorization will also include any necessary registration
 * of the device, at the GD Network Operation Center (infrastructure
 * activation), and at the enterprise (enterprise activation). See under
 * Activation, below, for more details.
 *
 * Authorization may include user interaction, see the documentation of the
 * authorize function, below, for details. All user interaction that is part
 * of authorization takes place in a user interface that is part of the GD
 * Runtime library, not part of the application.
 *
 * The authorization API is state-based and asynchronous. The initiation
 * function generally returns immediately. Success or failure of
 * authorization is then notified to the application code later, as a
 * transition of the <em>authorization state</em>. The application should
 * generally wait to be notified of transition to the "authorized" state before
 * attempting to utilize any other GD APIs.
 *
 * Further changes to the authorization state can take place, and are notified
 * to the application in the same way. See under Authorization State, below.
 *
 * \see \ref enterprisesimulation for instructions on building an application to
 * run in a special limited mode in which authorization with the enterprise is
 * only simulated.
 * \see <A
 *     href="https://community.good.com/docs/DOC-1121" target="_blank"
 * >Network Operation Center server addresses</A> on the Good Developer Network for IP address
 * and port number details of the GD Network Operation Center services.
 *
 * <H3>Authorization State</H3>
 * The GD Runtime maintains the authorization state of the application. The GD
 * APIs that can be utilized by the application depend on its current
 * authorization state.
 *
 * The initial state of the application when it starts is <em>not
 * authorized</em>. In this state the application can utilize the authorization
 * processing initiation API but cannot utilize any principal GD APIs, such as
 * secure store access and secure communication.
 *
 * After authorization has been initiated and has succeeded, the application
 * enters the <em>authorized </em>state. The principal GD APIs can then be
 * utilized.
 *
 * Authorization of the end user may be temporarily withdrawn, in which case the
 * application enters the <em>locked </em>state. This would happen when, for
 * example, the user does not interact with the application for an extended
 * period and the enterprise inactivity time out expires. Note that the
 * authorization of the application itself has not been withdrawn in this state,
 * only the authorization of the end user to access the application's data.\n
 * In the locked state, the GD Runtime superimposes an unlock screen on the
 * application user interface to prevent the user from interacting with the
 * application or viewing its data. Note that the GD Runtime does not block the
 * whole device user interface, which means that native notification features
 * and other ancillary mechanisms
 * could still be utilized by the application. The application must not cause
 * sensitive enterprise data to be displayed through these features and
 * mechanisms when in the locked state.\n
 * The application can continue to utilize the principal GD APIs, in the
 * background.
 *
 * After a temporary withdrawal ends, the application returns to the authorized
 * state. This would happen when, for example, the user enters their security
 * password in the unlock screen.
 *
 * Authorization may also be permanently withdrawn, in which case the
 * application enters the <em>wiped </em>state. This would happen when, for
 * example, the end user's entitlement to the application is removed by the
 * enterprise administrator. In the wiped state, the application cannot utilize
 * the principal GD APIs.
 * 
 * Transitions of the authorization state are notified by dispatching a
 * <TT>GDAppEvent</TT> object to the <TT>GDiOSDelegate</TT> instance in the
 * application. The event will have a number of attributes, including a type
 * value that indicates whether the user is now authorized.
 * 
 * The authorization states and their corresponding event type values are listed
 * in the following table.
 * <TABLE>
 *     <TR
 *         ><TH>State</TH
 *         ><TH>Description</TH

 *         enforcement action is to wipe the secure container.\n
 *         The application cannot use any GD APIs.</TD
 *     ><TD
 *         ><TT>GDAppEventNotAuthorized</TT>\n
 *         This is the same event type as the Locked state transition event.</TD
 *
 *     ></TR
 * ></TABLE
 * >The transitions in the above table are also shown in the
 * \ref st04gdauthorisation.
 *
 * The GD Runtime user interface includes all the necessary screens and messages
 * to inform the user of the authorization state. The application code needs
 * only to ensure:
 * - That it does not bypass the GD Runtime user interface.
 * - That it does not attempt to access the principal GD APIs prior to
 *   authorization.
 * - That it does not attempt to access the principal GD APIs after the
 *   authorization state has changed to wiped.
 * .
 *
 * 
 * <H3>API Restrictions</H3>
 * The application cannot use any of the principal Good Dynamics APIs before
 * authorization has succeeded. If the application attempts to do so, the Good
 * Dynamics Runtime generates an assertion,
 * which results in the application being terminated.
 * The Good Dynamics Runtime uses the Foundation <TT>NSAssert</TT> macro to
 * generate these assertions.
 *
 * The Good Dynamics Runtime does not
 * generate assertions
 * for transient conditions, but only for apparent programming errors in the
 * application. Consequently, these assertions are only
 * expected when the application is in development, and not when the application
 * is in production. The failure message of the
 * assertion will describe the programming error.
 *
 * The recommended approach is that the application should be allowed to
 * terminate, so that the failure message can be read
 * on the console.
 * The failure message will describe the programming error, which can then be
 * corrected.
 * For example, a message like the following could be seen in the logs:\n
 * <TT>My application [7506:40b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception
 * 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason:
 * 'Not authorized. Call [GDi</TT><TT>OS autho</TT><TT>rize] first.'</TT>
 *
 * <H4>Early Authorization</H4>
 * An application can initiate authorization at a number of stages in its
 * execution cycle. The typical stage for authorization initiation is the
 * <TT>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</TT> handler. Initiation in
 * this stage requires only that the application calls the <TT>authorize</TT>
 * function.
 *
 * An application could instead initiate authorization at an earlier stage of
 * the execution cycle. In that case, an additional initialization function
 * must also be called. Calling an initialization function enables early
 * authorization.
 *
 * There are two initialization functions:
 * - \link GDiOS::initializeWithClassConformingToUIApplicationDelegate: initializeWithClassConformingToUIApplicationDelegate:\endlink
 * - \link GDiOS::initializeWithClassNameConformingToUIApplicationDelegate: initializeWithClassNameConformingToUIApplicationDelegate:\endlink
 * .
 * Call either one of these to enable early authorization. The call should be
 * made prior to the <TT>UIApplicationMain</TT> call, which is in the
 * application <TT>main()</TT> subroutine in the <TT>main.m</TT> file, by
 * default.
 *
 * If an initialization function is not called and early authorization is
 * attempted, the Good Dynamics Runtime will generate an assertion. A message
 * like the following could be seen in the logs:\n
 * <TT>My application [7506:40b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception
 * 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason:
 * 'Not initialized. Either move the [GDi</TT><TT>OS authorize] call to your
 * application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: code, or call an initialization
 * function such as [GDi</TT><TT>OS
 * initializeWithClassConformingToUIApplicationDelegate:] prior to
 * UIApplicationMain.'</TT>
 * 
 * In some earlier versions of the GD SDK for iOS it was always necessary to
 * call an initialization function, even when not using early authorization.
 *
 * <H3>Activation</H3>
 * In Good Dynamics, activation refers to a number of registration procedures
 * that must be completed in order to access all platform capabilities. Once a
 * particular activation has been completed, registration credentials are stored
 * on the device. This means that each activation need only be processed once.
 *
 * Activations are generally transparent to the application. The application
 * will call a Good Dynamics authorization method, and the runtime will process
 * whichever activations are required.
 *
 * There are two activations in Good Dynamics.<DL
 * ><DT
 *     >Infrastructure activation</DT><DD
 *         >Recognition of the mobile device as a terminal by the
 *         Good Technology central server.</DD
 * ><DT
 *     >Enterprise activation</DT><DD
 *         >Association of the terminal with a provisioned end user at the
 *         enterprise. This requires the user to enter an activation key. The
 *         key can be sent to the user by email when they are provisioned, or
 *         made available through the Good Control self-service interface.</DD
 * ></DL>
 * \see \ref GC for details on how to provision a user for development purposes.
 * \see \ref enterprisesimulation for instructions on building an application to
 * run in a special limited mode in which there is no enterprise activation.
 *
 * <H3>Application identification</H3>
 * Unique Good Dynamics application identifiers (GD App IDs) are used to
 * identify GD mobile applications. GD App IDs are used in the mobile
 * application, and in the management user interface at the enterprise, the Good
 * Control console.
 *
 * In the mobile application, the GD App ID is set by the authorization call, as
 * documented in the <TT>authorize</TT> function reference, below. In the
 * Good Control console, the GD App ID is entered as part of application
 * registration, see the \ref GC.
 *
 * GD App IDs are textual and follow a typical naming convention. The reversed
 * Internet domain of the application developer forms the initial part of the GD
 * App ID. For example, applications developed by Good Technology have IDs that
 * begin "com.good." since Good Technology owns the good.com domain.
 *
 * The rest of the ID is made up of the application's name, possibly preceded by
 * a number of categories and sub-categories. Categories and sub-categories are
 * separated by full stops. For example, the ID of an example Good Dynamics
 * remote database application, made by Good Technology, could be:
 * "com.good.gd.examples.remotedb".
 *
 * Formally, the syntax of a GD App ID is a string that complies with the
 * following:
 * - Contains only the following ASCII characters: hyphen (dash), full stop
 * (period), numeric digit, lower-case letter.
 * - Conforms to the &lt;subdomain&gt; format defined in section
 * 2.3.1 of <A
 *   HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt"
 *   target="_blank"
 * >RFC1035</A>.
 *
 * <H3>Application user interface restrictions</H3>
 * The Good Dynamics Runtime monitors the application user interface in order to
 * enforce a number of enterprise security policies. For example, there may be a
 * policy that the user must always enter their security password when the
 * application makes the transition from background to foreground. There may
 * also be a policy that the user interface must be locked after a period of
 * inactivity.
 *
 * The application user interface must observe a number of restrictions in order
 * to enable monitoring by the Good Dynamics Runtime.
 *
 * The application must use the \link GDiOS::getWindow getWindow (GDiOS)\endlink function instead
 * of creating a new <TT>UIWindow</TT> object.
 *
 * The application must close any open modal dialogs when entering background.
 * This includes, for example, any <TT>UIAlertView</TT> messages that are open.
 * This can be done in the <TT>applicationDidEnterBackground:</TT> handler, by
 * calling the <TT>dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:</TT> method of the view
 * controller.
 *
 * \see <A
 *     HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAlertView_Class/UIAlertView/UIAlertView.html"
 *     target="_blank"
 * >UIAlertView class reference in the iOS Developer Library on apple.com</A>
 *
 *  \htmlonly <div class="bulletlists"> \endhtmlonly
 *
 * <H3>Build-Time Configuration</H3>
 * The following build-time configuration is mandatory for all Good Dynamics
 * applications.
 * 
 * The application must register a specific URL type on the device. This enables
 * Good Inter-Container Communication (ICC), which is required for enforcement
 * of any authentication delegation policy set by the enterprise.
 * 
 * The URL type must be the same as the application's native bundle identifier.
 * Within the URL type declaration, four URL schemes must be declared. Two
 * schemes must be declared that are the same as the URL type, with <TT>.sc</TT>
 * and <TT>.sc2</TT> appended. An additional scheme must be declared that is the
 * same as the URL type with <TT>.sc2.</TT> and then the GD Application Version
 * appended. In addition, <TT>com.good.gd.discovery</TT> must be declared as a
 * scheme. The URL type and schemes would be declared in the application's
 * Info.plist file, as usual.
 *
 * For example, if the native bundle identifier of the application was
 * <TT>com.example.gd.myapp</TT> then the URL type declared would also be
 * <TT>com.example.gd.myapp</TT> and the URL schemes would be:
 * - <TT>com.example.gd.myapp.sc</TT>
 * - <TT>com.example.gd.myapp.sc2</TT>
 * - <TT>com.example.gd.myapp.sc2.1.0.0.0</TT>
 * - <TT>com.good.gd.discovery</TT>
 * .
 * The Info.plist file of any of the sample applications supplied with the Good
 * Dynamics SDK can be used as a guide.
 *
 * Alternatively, add the following XML to the application's Info.plist file,
 * using a text editor. Change all four instances of <TT>com.iOS.App.ID</TT> to
 * the native bundle identifier of the application.
 * \code
 * <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
 * <array>
 *     <dict>
 *         <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
 *         <string>None</string>
 *         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
 *         <string>com.iOS.App.ID</string>
 *         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
 *         <array>
 *             <string>com.iOS.App.ID.sc</string>
 *             <string>com.iOS.App.ID.sc2</string>
 *             <string>com.iOS.App.ID.sc2.1.0.0.0</string>
 *             <string>com.good.gd.discovery</string>
 *         </array>
 *     </dict>
 * </array>
 * \endcode
 * Note that the first three <TT>CFBundleURLSchemes</TT> array items have a .sc
 * suffix, a .sc2 suffix and a .sc2.1.0.0.0 suffix applied to the native bundle
 * identifier. The <TT>CFBundleTypeRole</TT> element is not used by Good
 * Dynamics and could take another value, as required by the application.
 * 
 * In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The declarations just made should appear there.
 * 
 * The Good Dynamics Runtime checks the configuration during authorization
 * processing. The end user will not be authorized if the configuration is
 * incorrect.
 * 
 * The above configuration also enables Good Dynamics Application-Based
 * Services, see the   \link GDService GDService class reference\endlink.

 * [GDiOS initializeWithClassConformingToUIApplicationDelegate:[BrowserAppDelegate class]];
 * int retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([BrowserAppDelegate class]));
 * \endcode
 * The above code would be placed in the <TT>main()</TT> of the Browser
 * application.
 * 
 * <H3>Authorization</H3>
 * The following snippet shows initiation of Good Dynamics authorization.
 * \code
 * [GDiOS sharedInstance].delegate = self;
 * [[GDiOS sharedInstance] authorize];
 * \endcode
 * After executing the above code, the application would wait for its delegate
 * callback to be invoked. The invocation would have an event type of
 * <TT>GDAppEventAuthorized</TT> if the user was authorized. After that, the
 * application could make full use of all Good Dynamics capabilities.
 *
 * The above code relies on the identification parameters being in the
 * Info.plist file, as shown in the following snippet.
 * \code
 * <key>GDApplicationID</key>
 * <string>com.example.browser</string>
 * <key>GDApplicationVersion</key>
 * <string>1.0.0.0</string>
 * \endcode
 * The above is an extract from the XML of the application's Info.plist file.
 * The extract sets "com.example.browser" as the GD application ID, and
 * "1.0.0.0" as the GD application version.
 *
 * <H3>User interface pre-initialization</H3>
 * The following snippet shows some necessary steps that precede initialization
 * of the application's user interface. The recommended place in the code for
 * these steps is as shown in the snippet.
 * \code
 *
 * @synthesize window;
 *
 * - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
 * { 
 *     GDiOS *gdiOS = [GDiOS sharedInstance];
 *     self.window = [gdiOS getWindow];
 *     gdiOS.delegate = self;
 *     started = NO;
 *     // Following line will cause the GD Runtime user interface to open.
 *     [gdiOS authorize];
 *     return YES;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above snippet shows the following sequence of actions.
 * -# A reference to the GDiOS singleton object is obtained.
 * -# The application sets its window to be the <TT>UIWindow</TT> of the Good
 *    Dynamics Runtime.
 * -# The current class is set as the delegated event handler.
 * -# The <TT>started</TT> flag is set, to control initialization of the
 *    application's user interface, which is covered in the following snippet.
 *    The flag's declaration (not shown) would be <TT>BOOL</TT>.
 * -# The application initiates Good Dynamics authorization.
 * .
 * Authorization processing is asynchronous. On completion, an event will be
 * dispatched to the application's handler. The application completes user
 * interface initialization within its event handler, as shown in the following
 * code snippet.
 *
 * <H3>User interface initialization</H3>
 * The following snippet shows the recommended place in the code to initialize
 * the application's user interface.
 * \code
 *
 * -(void)handleEvent:(GDAppEvent*)anEvent
 * {
 *     switch (anEvent.type) {
 *         case GDAppEventAuthorized: {
 *             if (!started) {
 *                 [self initializeUI];
 *                 started = YES;
 *             }
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventNotAuthorized: {
 *             [self onNotAuthorized:anEvent];
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventRemoteSettingsUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventServicesUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventPolicyUpdate:
 *         default: {
 *             // This application ignores other types of event.
 *             break;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above code shows a simple GD Event Handler.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <TT>initializeUI</TT> function
 * when a <TT>GDAppEventAuthorized</TT> event is received for the first time.
 * The application's <TT>started</TT> flag is used to control first-time
 * execution. Initialization of this flag is shown in the previous snippet.\n
 * The <TT>initializeUI</TT> function would complete user interface
 * initialization, utilizing a reference to the Good Dynamics runtime's
 * <TT>UIWindow</TT>.
 * The previous snippet shows how the reference can be obtained.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <TT>onNotAuthorized</TT> function
 * whenever a <TT>GDAppEventNotAuthorized</TT> event is received.
