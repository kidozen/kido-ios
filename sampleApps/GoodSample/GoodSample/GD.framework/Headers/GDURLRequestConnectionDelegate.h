/** Delegate for managing the URL connections associated with a UIWebView control.
 * Connections for URL requests issued by a <TT>UIWebView</TT> control can be
 * managed by creating a class that implements this protocol.
 *
 * The callbacks in this protocol enable the application to:
 * - Respond to a certificate authentication challenge.
 * - Block a connection.
 * - Specify whether a connection will be routed direct to the Internet or via
 *   the Good Dynamics proxy infrastructure.
 * - Confirm that a connection was made, and confirm its routing.
 * .
 *
 * Implement this protocol if any of the following is required by the
 * application:
 * - Custom verification of electronic certificates for Secure Socket Layer or
 *   Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) connections.
 * - Mutual authentication of electronic certificates for SSL/TLS connections.
 * - Finer control over routing and filtering than is offered by Good Control
 *   client connection configuration.
 * .
 * But note that this protocol does not enable routing to an application server
 * that is behind the enterprise firewall and that has not been configured in
 * the enterprise Good Control console.
 *
 * Call the <TT>GDSetRequestConnectionDelegate:</TT> function in the
 * \link UIWebView(GDNET)\endlink category to set the delegate for a particular
 * <TT>UIWebView</TT> instance. The delegate callbacks will be executed on the
 * same thread in which the delegate was set.
 *
 * The callbacks in this protocol utilize an <TT>NSURLRequest</TT> object to
 * represent the request to which the callback invocation relates. See the <A
 *     HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLRequest_Class/Reference/Reference.html"
 *     target="_blank"
 * >NSURLRequest class reference</A> in the iOS Developer Library on apple.com
 * for details of how to access its attributes.

 * \see \ref GC and the online help available in the Good Control console.

 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust</TT> challenge occurs when a

 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodClientCertificate</TT> challenge occurs
 *   when the host requests a client certificate for mutual certificate
 *   authentication.
 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodNegotiate</TT> challenge occurs
 *   when access to the requested resource requires Kerberos or NTLM authentication.
 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodNTLM</TT> challenge occurs
 *   when access to the requested resource requires NTLM authentication.
 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPDigest</TT> challenge occurs
 *   when access to the requested resource requires HTTP Digest authentication.
 * - An <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic</TT> challenge occurs
 *   when access to the requested resource requires HTTP Basic authentication.

 * <TT>NSURLAuthenticationChallengeSender</TT> methods must be used within
 * five seconds of the invocation or no response will be assumed.
 *
 * If host certificate verification is required and the application does not
 * respond, then the connection will not be established. If a client certificate
 * is requested and the application does not respond, then the connection may or
 * may not be established depending only on the configuration of the host server.
 * If an HTTP resource requires authentication and the application does not respond,
 * the request will eventually fail with a timeout error.
