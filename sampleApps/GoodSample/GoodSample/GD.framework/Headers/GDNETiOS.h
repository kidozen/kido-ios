 * <H3>Overview</H3>
 * The GD Socket API is asynchronous and state-based.
 * The application attaches its own event-handler callbacks to the
 * GD Socket object. The callback functions are invoked when socket events
 * occur, or when the socket changes state. Which API functions can
 * be called by the application at any time also depend on the socket's state.
 *
 * Callbacks are attached through a delegate class.
 * The states in which each callback may be expected to be invoked are
 * detailed in the delegate class's documentation, see GDSocketDelegate.
 *
 * The availability of API functions, and what actions take place,
 * are detailed below, and summarized in the following table.
 * The table also summarizes which callbacks may expect to be invoked
 * in each state.

 *
 * <H3>Sending and Receiving Data</H3>
 * Sending data through a GD Socket is a two-stage operation.
 * The first stage is to add the data to the socket's outbound buffer.
 * The socket's outbound buffer is represented by the
 * <TT>writestream</TT> property, and is
 * accessed using the GD Direct Byte Buffer API.
 * The second stage is to send the contents of the buffer
 * through the socket connection.
 * To send the buffer, call the <TT>write</TT> function.
 *
 * Reading data from a GD Socket is asynchronous.
 * When data is received at the device, the data is stored in the socket's
 * inbound buffer. The application is then notified
 * that data is available to read, by invocation of the
 * delegate <TT>onRead</TT> callback.
 * In the callback, the application consumes the received data from the
 * inbound buffer. The inbound buffer is represented by the
 * <TT>readStream</TT> property, and is
 * accessed using the GD Direct Byte Buffer API.
 *
 * <H3>SSL/TLS Security</H3>
 * The GD Socket API supports use of a Secure Socket Layer connection or
 * Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to send and receive data.
 *
 * Using SSL/TLS requires that the remote end has a suitable certificate, and
 * that the certificate is valid. A number of checks for validity are made by
 * the Good Dynamics Runtime, some of which can be disabled by the application.
 *
 * The usual secure socket connection sequence would be as follows.
 * The application makes a first connection attempt. In the
 * first attempt, full certificate checking is enabled.
 * If a security error is encountered, this request will fail.
 * The application can then disable some checking, and make a second
 * connection attempt, to the same address as the first connection attempt.
 * With less rigorous checking, the second attempt may succeed where the
 * first failed.
 *
 * The relevant parts of the API are:
 * - Use of SSL/TLS is specified by including
 * <TT>andUseSSL:</TT>&nbsp;<TT>YES</TT> in the call to <TT>init</TT>
 * - Security errors are treated the same as connection failures.
 * - The member functions <TT>disableHostVerification</TT> and
 * <TT>disablePeerVerification</TT> are used to reduce the level
 * of security checking.
 * Setting <TT>disablePeerVerification</TT> implicitly
 * sets <TT>disableHostVerification</TT>.
 * .
 * 
 * <H4>Secure Protocol Selection</H4>
 * Establishing an SSL/TLS connection can involve negotiating and retrying, in
 * order to select a secure protocol that is supported by client and server. The
 * Good Dynamics (GD) Runtime handles client-side negotiation and retrying, when
 * the secure communication APIs are in use. By default, the GD Runtime does not
 * offer the TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols for SSL/TLS connections with an
 * application server.
 *
 * These protocols can be enabled, as follows.
 * -# Add a new row to the application's Info.plist fi<TT></TT>le*:
 *     - Key: <TT>GDControlTLSVersions</TT>
 *     - Type: <TT>String</TT> (the default)
 *     .
 * -# Set the value to:
 *     - <TT>GDEnableTLS1.1</TT> to enable the TLSv1.1 protocol.
 *     - <TT>GDEnableTLS1.2</TT> to enable both TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 *     .
 *     Alternatively, the value can be an array containing one or both of the
 *     above strings as separate items.
 * .
 * (*In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The setting just made should appear there.)
 * 
 * The setting only affects connections to application servers, not the
 * connection with the GD infrastructure itself. The protocols are disabled by
 * default because there are many installed web servers with which a connection
 * cannot be established after one of these protocols has been offered.
 *
 * <H3>Enterprise server connection notes</H3>
 * The GD secure communications APIs can be used to connect to servers that are
 * behind the enterprise firewall.
 * This applies to socket connections and HTTP requests.
 * Note the following when using this capability:
 *
 * The address of the application server to which connection is being made
 * must be registered in the enterprise's Good Control (GC) console.
 * The address could be registered as the application's server, or as an
 * additional server. See detailed instructions in the \ref GC and in the GC
 * console help files.
 *
 * Note. The application server configuration in the GC can
 * be obtained in the application code by using the
 * \link GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS)\endlink function.
 *
 * The connection to the application server will be made through the Good
 * Dynamics proxy infrastructure.The status of the mobile application's
 * connection to the proxy infrastructure should therefore be checked before
 * attempting to open the socket, or send the HTTP request. The
 * \ref GDPushConnection::isConnected function can be used to check the status.
 * If there is no connection to the proxy infrastructure, this can be initiated
 * in the normal way. See under GDPushConnection.

 * <H3>Enterprise server connection notes</H3>
 * The GD secure communications APIs can be used to connect to servers that are
 * behind the enterprise firewall.
 * This applies to socket connections and HTTP requests.
 * Note the following when using this capability:
 *
 * The address of the application server to which connection is being made
 * must be registered in the enterprise's Good Control (GC) console.
 * The address could be registered as the application's server, or as an
 * additional server. See detailed instructions in the \ref GC and in the GC
 * console help files.
 *
 * Note. The application server configuration in the GC can
 * be obtained in the application code by using the
 * \link GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS)\endlink function.
 *
 * The connection to the application server will be made through the Good
 * Dynamics proxy infrastructure.The status of the mobile application's
 * connection to the proxy infrastructure should therefore be checked before
 * attempting to open the socket, or send the HTTP request. The
 * \ref GDPushConnection::isConnected function can be used to check the status.
 * If there is no connection to the proxy infrastructure, this can be initiated
 * in the normal way. See under GDPushConnection.
 * 
<H3>HTTPS Security</H3>
 * Good Dynamics secure communications support HTTPS, using a
 * Secure Socket Layer connection or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
 * to send the HTTP request and receive the response.
 *
 * Using SSL/TLS requires that the remote end has a suitable certificate,
 * and that the certificate is valid. A number of checks for validity are
 * madeby the Good Dynamics Runtime, some of which can be disabled
 * by the application.
 *
 * The usual HTTPS request sequence would be as follows.
 * The application makes a first attempt to send the HTTPS request. In the
 * first attempt, full checking is enabled.
 * If a security error is encountered, this request will fail.
 * The application can then disable some checking, and attempt to send
 * a second request to the same address as the first request. With less
 * rigorous checking, the second attempt may succeed where the first failed.
 *
 * The relevant parts of the API are:
 * - Use of HTTPS is specified by addressing the request
 * to a URL with "https" as its scheme, as in "https://www.example.com".
 * - Security errors are treated the same as connection failures. The
 * <TT>getStatusText</TT> return value will begin with <TT>"SSL"</TT>.
 * - The functions <TT>disableHostVerification</TT> and
 * <TT>disablePeerVerification</TT> are used to reduce the level
 * of security checking.
 * Setting <TT>disablePeerVerification</TT> implicitly
 * sets <TT>disableHostVerification</TT>.
 * .
 * 
 * <H4>Secure Protocol Selection</H4>
 * Establishing an SSL/TLS connection can involve negotiating and retrying, in
 * order to select a secure protocol that is supported by client and server. The
 * Good Dynamics (GD) Runtime handles client-side negotiation and retrying, when
 * the secure communication APIs are in use. By default, the GD Runtime does not
 * offer the TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols for SSL/TLS connections with an
 * application server.
 *
 * These protocols can be enabled, as follows.
 * -# Add a new row to the application's Info.plist fi<TT></TT>le*:
 *     - Key: <TT>GDControlTLSVersions</TT>
 *     - Type: <TT>String</TT> (the default)
 *     .
 * -# Set the value to:
 *     - <TT>GDEnableTLS1.1</TT> to enable the TLSv1.1 protocol.
 *     - <TT>GDEnableTLS1.2</TT> to enable both TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 *     .
 *     Alternatively, the value can be an array containing one or both of the
 *     above strings as separate items.
 * .
 * (*In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The setting just made should appear there.)
 * 
 * The setting only affects connections to application servers, not the
 * connection with the GD infrastructure itself. The protocols are disabled by
 * default because there are many installed web servers with which a connection
 * cannot be established after one of these protocols has been offered.
 * 
<H3>HTTP proxy support</H3>
 * HTTP and HTTPS requests can be relayed by an HTTP or HTTPS proxy that resides
 * on the Internet or behind the enterprise firewall.
 * Authentication with the proxy is supported.
 *
 * See the \link
 * GDHttpRequest::enableHttpProxy:withPort:withUser:withPass:withAuth:
 * enableHttpProxy:\endlink and \link
 * GDHttpRequest::disableHttpProxy disableHttpProxy\endlink function
 * references for details.
 *
 * When making HTTPS requests through an HTTP proxy, SSL/TLS certificate
 * verification must be disabled.
 * Certificate verification while using an HTTP proxy is not supported.
 * See under HTTPS Security, above.
 * Good Dynamics HTTP data communication does not go via the proxy specified in the
 * device's native settings, if any.
 * 
<H3>HTTP authentication</H3>
 * The Good Dynamics (GD) Runtime supports the following mechanisms for
 * authentication with HTTP servers: Basic Access, Digest Access, NTLM, and
 * Kerberos.
 * Except for Kerberos, all these mechanisms are also supported for
 * authentication with HTTP proxies.
 *
 * <H4>Kerberos Authentication</H4>
 *  \htmlonly <div class="bulletlists"> \endhtmlonly
 * The GD Runtime supports Kerberos version 5 authentication. When using
 * Kerberos authentication:
 * - Supply username and password credentials
 * as documented in the relevant function references.
 * - The username must be in the <EM>user</EM><TT>\@</TT><EM>realm</EM> long
 *   form. The short form <EM>shortrealm</EM><TT>\\</TT><EM>user</EM> is not
 *   supported.
 * - The GD Runtime will use these credentials to request Kerberos tickets. The
 *   tickets are persisted on the device in the Good Dynamics secure store. (The
 *   ticket store is not generally accessible to the application, but see
 *    \link GDCacheController::clearCredentialsForMethod:  clearCredentialsForMethod:\endlink.)
 * - The stored Kerberos tickets are then used to authenticate the user on any
 *   site that supports Kerberos authentication. So long as the ticket continues
 *   to be accepted, there is no need for credentials to be supplied again, and
 *   no authentication challenge.
 * - This continues until a site does not accept the stored ticket (e.g. the
 *   ticket has expired and cannot be renewed).
 * - The Kerberos realm must be accessible. Usually, this means that the
 *   Kerberos realm must be listed as an Additional Server in the Good Control
 *   console. See the \ref GC.
 * - Kerberos realms are treated differently to server addresses. An unqualified
 *   server address may be resolved according to configuration in the Good
 *   Control console, but the short form of a Kerberos realm cannot be resolved
 *   in this way. Note that the short form of the Kerberos realm will typically
 *   be the form used when logging in to the enterprise LAN at the desktop. The
 *   long form is often, but not necessarily, the short form with the domain
 *   appended.
 * - Kerberos delegation can be allowed or disallowed. See
 * \link GDCacheController::kerberosAllowDelegation:
 * GDCacheController::kerberosAllowDelegation:\endlink.
 * .
 *  \htmlonly </div> \endhtmlonly
 * 
<H3>HTTP Cookie Handling</H3>
 * By default, HTTP cookies received through Good Dynamics secure communication
 * are handled automatically:
 * - Set-cookie: headers that are received as part of an HTTP response are
 *   processed and then added to subsequent matching requests.
 * - Persistent cookies are written to cookie storage in the Good Dynamics
 *   secure store. Storage takes place when the request's ready state becomes
 *   <TT>GDHttpRequest_DONE</TT>, if <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT> is in use.
 * .
 * The Good Dynamics cookie store persists between executions of the
 * application, and if the mobile device is switched off. The contents of the
 * store can be managed with the native <TT>NSHTTPCookieStorage</TT> API, as can
 * non-persistent cookies received through Good Dynamics secure communication.
 *
 * Automatic handling of HTTP cookies received through Good Dynamics secure
 * communication can be disabled, as follows:
 * - For <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT>, call the
 *   <TT>disableCookieHandling</TT> function in the
 *   <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT> class.
 * - For <TT>GDURLLoad</TT><TT>ingSystem</TT>, call the
 *   <TT>setHTTPShouldHandleCookies:</TT> function in the native
 *   <TT>NSMutableURLRequest</TT> class, as usual.
 * .

/** Manage access across the firewall via the URL Loading System.
 * Good Dynamics applications can utilize the native URL Loading System to
 * communicate with servers that are behind the enterprise firewall.
 * This is an alternative approach to using GDHttpRequest.
 * Communication across the enterprise firewall utilizes the Good Dynamics
 * proxy infrastructure, which is secure.
 *
 * Access across the firewall is enabled in the URL Loading System by default,
 * when authorization of the application succeeds.
 * The application can subsequently disable and enable access.
 * If the application's or the user's authorization is withdrawn, access is
 * implicitly disabled for the duration of the withdrawal.
 *
 * Access across the firewall utilizes the Good Dynamics proxy infrastructure.
 * The Good Dynamics Runtime includes a class that interfaces with the
 * infrastructure. The interfacing class is also compatible to be registered as
 * a URL handler in the URL Loading System. Enabling and disabling access across
 * the firewall actually registers and de-registers the interfacing class. This
 * means that, when access is disabled, the default URL Loading System handlers
 * will service any URL requests.
 *
 * <B>Note that synchronous request calls should not be made from the main
 * application thread.</B>
 *
 *  \htmlonly <div class="bulletlists"> \endhtmlonly
 * When access is enabled, the normal URL Loading System classes can be used
 * to communicate with servers that are behind the firewall, using standard
 * Internet protocols. For an overview, refer to the <A
 * HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/"
 * target="_blank">URL Loading System Programming Guide in the iOS Developer
 * Library on apple.com</A>. Note the following details:
 * - Only the HTTP and HTTPS schemes are ever handled by the Good Dynamics
 *   Runtime. FTP and other schemes are never handled by the Good Dynamics
 *   Runtime, and hence cannot be used to access resources that are behind the
 *   firewall.
 * - Enterprise servers that are not listed in the Good Control console cannot
 *   be accessed, unless they are accessible from the Internet.
 * - SSL/TLS client authenticity verification is not supported.
 *   <TT>NSURLConnection</TT> <TT>didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge</TT> will
 *   not be received while authenticating connections.
 * - SSL/TLS server authenticity verification is managed internally according
 *   to the same rules outlined in \ref GDHttpRequest.
 *   <TT>NSURLConnection</TT> <TT>didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge</TT> will
 *   not be received while authenticating connections.
 * - Authorization credentials are supported with the following notes:\n
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic</TT> is supported.\n
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodDefault</TT> is treated as
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic</TT>.\n
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPDigest</TT> is supported.\n
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodNTLM</TT> is supported, specifically: NTLMv1,
 *   NTLMv2, and NTLM2 Session.\n
 *   <TT>NSURLAuthenticationMethodNegotiate</TT> is supported for Kerberos
 *   version 5.
 * - When Kerberos authentication is in use, note the following:
 *   - Credentials are initially taken in the same way as other credentials,
 *     with the same specified persistence.
 *   - The credentials will be a username in the form
 *     <EM>user</EM><TT>\@</TT><EM>realm</EM>, and a password.
 *   - The credentials are used to request Kerberos tickets, which are stored.
 *   - The stored Kerberos tickets are then used to authenticate the user on
 *     any site that supports Kerberos authentication. So long as the ticket
 *     continues to be accepted, there is no need for credentials to be supplied
 *     again, and no authentication challenge.
 *   - This continues until a site does not accept the stored ticket (e.g. the
 *     ticket has expired and cannot be renewed).
 *   - The Kerberos realm must be accessible. Usually, this means that the
 *     Kerberos realm must be listed as an Additional Server in the Good
 *     Control console. See the \ref GC.
 *   - Kerberos delegation can be allowed or disallowed. See
 *     \link GDCacheController::kerberosAllowDelegation:\endlink.
 *   .
 * - Authorization credentials are persisted as per the
 *   <TT>NSURLCredentialPersistence</TT> flag of <TT>NSURLCredential</TT>:\n
 *   <TT>NSURLCredentialPersistenceNone</TT> credential is used for this
 *   connection only\n
 *   <TT>NSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession</TT> credential is persisted in

 *
 * <H3>Multiple Authentication Methods</H3>
 * An HTTP server may support multiple authentication methods. For example, a
 * server could support both NTLM and Kerberos authentication. By default, the
 * GD Runtime handles this by selecting the first authentication method
 * presented.
 *
 * The application can implement its own handling for multiple authentication
 * methods, as follows:
 * -# Add a new row to the application's Info.plist fi<TT></TT>le:
 *     - Key: <TT>GDRejectAuthSupport</TT>
 *     - Type: <TT>Boolean</TT>
 *     - Value: <TT>YES</TT>
 *     .
 *     (In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one
 *     has been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being
 *     built. The setting just made should appear there.)
 * -# Implement a <TT>connection::willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge</TT>
 *    callback.
 * -# In the application code for the callback, call the
 *    <TT>rejectProtectionSpaceAndContinueWithChallenge</TT> function, where
 *    necessary.
 * .
 * The following code snippet illustrates a simple implementation of the
 * callback mentioned in the above.
 * \code
 * - (void)connection:
 *     (NSURLConnection *)connection
 * willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:
 *     (NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge
 * {
 *     if(
 *         [[challenge protectionSpace] authenticationMethod] !=
 *         NSURLAuthenticationMethodNTLM
 *     ) {
 *         // Reject anything that is not NTLM, i.e. reject Negotiate.
 *         [[challenge sender]
 *             rejectProtectionSpaceAndContinueWithChallenge:challenge];
 *     }
 *     else {
 *         NSURLCredential* cred =
 *             [NSURLCredentialcredentialWithUser:@"abc"
 *                                       password:@"abc"
 *                                    persistence:NSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession];
 *
 *         [[challenge sender] useCredential:cred
 *                forAuthenticationChallenge:challenge];
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode

 *
 * <H3>HTTP Cookie Handling</H3>
 * By default, HTTP cookies received through Good Dynamics secure communication
 * are handled automatically:
 * - Set-cookie: headers that are received as part of an HTTP response are
 *   processed and then added to subsequent matching requests.
 * - Persistent cookies are written to cookie storage in the Good Dynamics
 *   secure store. Storage takes place when the request's ready state becomes
 *   <TT>GDHttpRequest_DONE</TT>, if <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT> is in use.
 * .
 * The Good Dynamics cookie store persists between executions of the
 * application, and if the mobile device is switched off. The contents of the
 * store can be managed with the native <TT>NSHTTPCookieStorage</TT> API, as can
 * non-persistent cookies received through Good Dynamics secure communication.
 *
 * Automatic handling of HTTP cookies received through Good Dynamics secure
 * communication can be disabled, as follows:
 * - For <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT>, call the
 *   <TT>disableCookieHandling</TT> function in the
 *   <TT>GDHttp</TT><TT>Request</TT> class.
 * - For <TT>GDURLLoad</TT><TT>ingSystem</TT>, call the
 *   <TT>setHTTPShouldHandleCookies:</TT> function in the native
 *   <TT>NSMutableURLRequest</TT> class, as usual.
 * .
