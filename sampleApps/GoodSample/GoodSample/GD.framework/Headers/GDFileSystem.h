/** NSPersistentStoreCoordinator subclass that supports an encrypted binary
 * store type in Core Data.
 * Good Dynamics applications can store Core Data objects in the Secure Store.
 *
 * Using this class instead of the default <TT>NSPersistentStoreCoordinator</TT>
 * allows the use of the following additional Core Data store types:<DL
 * ><DT><TT>GDEncryptedBinaryStoreType</TT></DT><DD
 * >Encrypted binary store that is stored in the Good Dynamics Secure Store.\n
 * Use this in place of <TT>NSBinaryStoreType</TT>.</DD
 * ><DT><TT>GDEncryptedIncrementalStoreType</TT></DT><DD
 * >Encrypted incremental store that is stored in the Good Dynamics Secure
 * Store.\n
 * Use this in place of <TT>NSSQLiteStoreType</TT>.\n
 * This store type is based on <TT>NSIncrementalStoreType</TT> and
 * is therefore only available in iOS 5.0 or later.</DD
 * ></DL>
 *
 *  \htmlonly <div class="bulletlists"> \endhtmlonly
 * Note the following details:
 * - When these store types are in use, the <TT>URL</TT> parameter will be an
 * absolute path within the Secure File System.
 * - Use of this class with store types other than the above results in
 * identical behavior to using the default class.
 * The above additional store types cannot be used with the default class.
 * - Data can be migrated from an <TT>NSSQLiteStoreType</TT> store to a
 * <TT>GDEncryptedIncrementalStoreType</TT> store.
 * Use the Core Data migration API to do this.
 * For an example, see the CoreData sample application supplied with the Good
 * Dynamics SDK.
 * (It is not possible to import an <TT>NSSQLiteStoreType</TT> store file
 * directly into the Secure File System, and then use it as a
 * <TT>GDEncryptedIncrementalStoreType</TT> store.)
 * - Core Data stores of the above types cannot be accessed until Good Dynamics
 * authorization processing has completed.
 * This means that construction of the Managed Object Context, and the
 * population of views, must be deferred until after Good Dynamics authorization.
 * (For an example of deferred construction and population, see the CoreData
 * sample application supplied with the Good Dynamics SDK.)

/** Secure File System.
 * The secure file system is part of the Good Dynamics Secure Storage
 * feature.
 *
 * For applications, the secure file system behaves like the default file
 * system, with the following exceptions.
 * - All data within the secure file system is stored on the device
 * in an encrypted form.
 * - Directory and file names are also encrypted.
 * - There is no current working directory in the secure file system. Paths should
 * always be specified as absolute paths, beginning with a <TT>/</TT> character.
 * .
 * The encryption method used may require that the user enters a
 * security password before the application can access the secure file system.
 * This depends on enterprise security policy.
 *
 * The secure file system cannot be accessed until Good Dynamics authorization
 * processing is complete, see under  \link GDiOS::authorize: authorize (GDiOS)\endlink.
 * 
 * The functions in this API utilize <TT>NSError</TT> in a conventional way. Function calls accept as a parameter the location of a pointer to <TT>NSError</TT>, i.e. a pointer to a pointer, with type <TT>NSError**</TT>. The location may be <TT>nil</TT>. If the location is not <TT>nil</TT>, and an error occurs, the Good Dynamics Runtime overwrites the pointer at the specified location with the address of an object that describes the error that occurred.

 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows the following, in sequence.
 * 
 * Creation of a directory and sub-directory in a single API call, to the
 * <TT>createDirectoryAtPath:</TT> function. The directory is named
 * <TT>Hello/</TT> and is in the root of the secure file system. The
 * sub-directory is named <TT>my/</TT> and is beneath the <TT>Hello/</TT>
 * directory.
 * 
 * Creation of an <TT>NSData</TT> object from an <TT>NSString</TT> containing
 * <TT>"Hello my world!"</TT>.
 * 
 * Creation of a file, <TT>world.txt</TT> in the previously created
 * sub-directory, by writing the contents of the <TT>NSData</TT> object in a
 * single API call, to the <TT>writeToFile:</TT> function.
 *
 * <H3>Get statistics for secure file</H3>

 *      NSLog( @"Stat OK. Length: %lld. Last modified: %@\n",
 *             myStat.fileLen, [lastModified description] );

 * deleted. If deletion of the original fails, the encrypted file in the store
 * is not deleted.
