This is a the data visualization sample application

You need to have an application key for this to work. You can get it in the details of your Kidozen’s application. 

First build kidozen's SDK. To do so, open Kidozen's SDK project, select the kidozen.client.fat and build. This will create the required library and then this application will be able to run.

After building, run this application.

Also, have a look at the documentation at Kidozen’s site. http://docs.kidozen.com/data-visualization-using-ios-sdk/
